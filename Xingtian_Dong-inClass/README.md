### Working with CSS transitions and animations and JavaScript/jQuery

Recently, we covered CSS animations and transitions in lecture during class.

Previously, the only way to accomplish a lot of the things we do with CSS animations and transitions was through the use of javascript. Either through programatically making the animation happen or using some sort of event handler to make it fire off.

For this project, we are going to use the included HTML document to showcase some of what we learned. The CSS file is where all the magic will happen. And a JS file will handle the interactions.

JS or jQuery can be used for handling user interaction on the page. For example, clicking an element to trigger the transition. Basic handlers like the ones we demonstrated in class should do just fine.

## Requirements:
 - create at least 4 CSS transitions. These can be on a number of elements, and you can transition any CSS property you want
 - create at least 1 CSS animation, using keyframes to make it happen (some common implementations of this include loading spinners that don't use any type of animated gif)
 - Use the book and/or the internet at large to complete these tasks
 - if you are implenting something you like form the internet, make it your own. Make sure to include a link to where the technique originally came from so I can check to see that you made it your own
 - you are in creative control on this one as well, just make sure the tranisitons and animation happen
 - this can be one page or miltiple pages, just don't put the code there without thought
 - you don't need to style everything on the page (just make sure it looks decent)
 - use vanilla js or jQuery at least 3 times
 - the js file is not included here, so you will have to create one
 - use a cdn link to access jQuery and make sure to put any scripts you write that depend on jQuery below the actual jQuery include

## Other Info
 - you can submit a zip file via email or you can make a pull request using github, whichever works best for you
 - you may use the internet as a reference, but please remeber to cite code taken from somewhere else
 - you may use a framework such as bootstrap or foundation if you like (js from these frameworks can count toward the js or jQuery requirement)
 - you may collaborate with a classmate, but don't copy their code and vice versa
 
## Grading
 - make sure everything works, if the code is broken you will lose points
 - CSS should be in the CSS files, JS in the JS files, etc
 - as always, let me know if you have any questions
